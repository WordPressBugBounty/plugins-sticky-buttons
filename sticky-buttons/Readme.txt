== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The buttons do not appear on my website. How can I fix this? =
If the buttons don't appear, it's often due to **caching**. Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Clear your browser cache** – Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) to reload without cache.
2. **Clear your WordPress cache** – If you're using a caching plugin (like WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, or LiteSpeed Cache), clear the cache from its settings.
3. **Purge server cache** – If your hosting uses caching (e.g., Cloudflare, SiteGround, Nginx), clear the cache from your hosting control panel.
4. **Disable caching temporarily** – If the issue persists, deactivate your caching plugin temporarily and verify whether the buttons appear.

= Buttons are visible only to administrators, not regular users. Why? =
Check if **"Test Mode"** is enabled. When Test Mode is activated, sticky buttons are visible **only to site administrators** and not to regular visitors.

= Can I change the position of the sticky buttons? =
Yes! You can easily position the buttons on the **left, right, top, or bottom** of the screen from the plugin settings.

= Can I display buttons only on certain pages? =
Yes! In the **Lite version**, you can:
- **Show buttons sitewide** (on all pages).
- **Insert buttons manually** using the shortcode `[Sticky-Buttons id="1"]` to display them only on specific pages or posts.

In the **Pro version**, you gain advanced controls to display buttons based on categories, post types, specific pages, user roles, and more.

= Can I use multiple sets of buttons on the same page? =
Absolutely! You can create and display **multiple sets of sticky buttons** simultaneously. Each set can be individually configured and controlled.

= How does the "Mobile Rules" (Double Click) feature work? =
On touch devices, there is no "hover" state. When **Mobile Rules** is enabled:
1. **First Click:** Displays the button's label so the user can see what the button does.
2. **Second Click:** Opens the link or triggers the action.
If the user doesn't click a second time, the label automatically hides after 3 seconds.

= What is the difference between Fixed, Absolute, and Static positions? =
*   **Fixed (Sticky):** Buttons "float" over the content and stay visible while scrolling.
*   **Static:** Buttons are placed directly where you insert the shortcode (e.g., inside a post or page content).
*   **Absolute:** Buttons are positioned relative to the nearest parent container, useful for specific layout designs.

= How can I use Tags to organize my menus? =
Tags allow you to group your menus (e.g., "Promo", "Social", "Contact"). You can assign a tag in the menu settings and then use the filter at the top of the menu list to quickly find all sets belonging to that category.

= Does the plugin work with page builders like Elementor, Gutenberg, or Divi? =
Yes! You can copy the shortcode `[Sticky-Buttons id="XX"]` and paste it into any "Shortcode" or "Text" widget/block. This is especially useful when using the **Static** position to place buttons exactly where you want them in your layout.

= How do I transfer my settings to another website? =
Use the **Export** action in the menu list to download a `.json` file. On your new site, go to the "Tools" or "Import" section of the plugin, upload this file, and click **Import**. All colors, icons, and configurations will be restored.

= How to create a WhatsApp or Telegram button? =
It's simple! 
1. Create a new button set.
2. In the **Link** field, enter your direct message URL (e.g., `https://wa.me/yournumber` for WhatsApp or `https://t.me/yourusername` for Telegram).
3. Select the corresponding icon from the **Font Awesome** library.
4. Set the button color (e.g., green for WhatsApp) to make it recognizable.

= How to add a Login, Logout, or Register button? =
In the button settings, look for the **Item Type** dropdown. Instead of "Link," select **Login**, **Logout**, or **Register**. The plugin will automatically generate the correct WordPress system URLs for these actions.

= How can I create a bottom navigation bar for mobile? =
1. Set the **Position** to "Bottom Center" or "Bottom Left/Right".
2. Choose a "Square" or "Circle" **Shape**.
3. Use the **Mobile Rules** to ensure the labels are displayed correctly on touch screens.
4. This creates a professional, app-like navigation experience for your mobile visitors.

= How can I hide buttons on mobile or desktop only? =
In the plugin settings, you will find options for **"Hide on smaller screens"** and **"Hide on larger screens"**. 
- Enable **"Hide on smaller screens"** and set the breakpoint (e.g., 480px) to hide buttons on phones.
- Enable **"Hide on larger screens"** and set the breakpoint (e.g., 1200px) to hide buttons on wide desktop screens.

= How do I use Sticky Buttons on a multisite? =
If you're running a WordPress multisite network, **do not activate the plugin network-wide**. Instead, activate Sticky Buttons separately **on each individual site** where you plan to use it.

= Do Sticky Buttons slow down my website? =
No, **Sticky Buttons is lightweight, optimized for speed, and designed for minimal impact** on your site's performance.
