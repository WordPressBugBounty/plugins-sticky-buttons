== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The buttons do not appear on my website. How can I fix this? =
If the buttons don't appear, it's often due to **caching**. Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Clear your browser cache** – Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) to reload without cache.
2. **Clear your WordPress cache** – If you're using a caching plugin (like WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, or LiteSpeed Cache), clear the cache from its settings.
3. **Purge server cache** – If your hosting uses caching (e.g., Cloudflare, SiteGround, Nginx), clear the cache from your hosting control panel.
4. **Disable caching temporarily** – If the issue persists, deactivate your caching plugin temporarily and verify whether the buttons appear.

= Buttons are visible only to administrators, not regular users. Why? =
Check if **"Test Mode"** is enabled. When Test Mode is activated, sticky buttons are visible **only to site administrators** and not to regular visitors.

= Can I change the position of the sticky buttons? =
Yes! You can easily position the buttons on the **left, right, top, or bottom** of the screen from the plugin settings.

= Can I display buttons only on certain pages? =
Yes! In the **Lite version**, you can:
- **Show buttons sitewide** (on all pages).
- **Insert buttons manually** using the shortcode `[Sticky-Buttons id="1"]` to display them only on specific pages or posts.

In the **Pro version**, you gain advanced controls to display buttons based on categories, post types, specific pages, user roles, and more.

= Can I use multiple sets of buttons on the same page? =
Absolutely! You can create and display **multiple sets of sticky buttons** simultaneously. Each set can be individually configured and controlled.

= How do I use Sticky Buttons on a multisite? =
If you're running a WordPress multisite network, **do not activate the plugin network-wide**. Instead, activate Sticky Buttons separately **on each individual site** where you plan to use it.

= Do Sticky Buttons slow down my website? =
No, **Sticky Buttons is lightweight, optimized for speed, and designed for minimal impact** on your site's performance.
